# Cache-Controller

The purpose of this project was to understand the functionality of  a cache controller and its interactions within a memory system, made up of a CPU and main memory. The cache (SRAM) and main memory (SDRAM) were implemented using Block RAM in Xilinix. The project was accomplished by designing the controller such that it was able to handle read/write requests from the CPU and memory block replacement. The approach taken for this project was as such; Cache controller was drawn out into block, state and process diagrams to understand all the different aspects behind the controller. Once there was a clear understanding of all the cache controller processes, the code was implemented in VHDL in order to begin the simulations. The implementation allowed representation of different signals into waveforms to check if the cache controller logic works. Finally, all the CPU requests, which were transmitted to the cache controller, were correctly processed with the states specified in the code, demonstrating that the cache controller was implementing correctly.
